;A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published in 1770
;by the German mathematician J.H. Lambert.
;
;Define a procedure (tan-cf x k) that computes an approximation to the tangent
;function based on Lambert's formula. k specifies the number of terms to compute,
;as in Exercise 1-37.
